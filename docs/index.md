GEP Qi Studio is an agent platform for designing, configuring, and executing workflow-based AI agents. It provides a visual builder for agent orchestrations, tool integration, and real-time execution with streaming feedback.

## Who this is for

Agent developers who need to build, iterate, and run reliable AI workflows without managing the underlying runtime mechanics.

## What you can do

- Build agent orchestrations using a drag-and-drop workflow canvas.
- Configure nodes for LLMs, tools, rules, guardrails, and nested workflows.
- Manage tools via MCP servers and system tool catalogs.
- Execute workflows with live streaming and human-in-the-loop (HITL) interrupts.
- Work across clients, domains, environments, apps, and modules.

## Quick start paths

- **New to the platform:** Start with `getting-started`.
- **Building a workflow:** See `build/canvas` and `build/nodes/index`.
- **Running workflows:** See `run/execution` and `run/streaming`.
