description: Connect to tools via Model Context Protocol servers.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide dynamic tool discovery. Once a server is configured, its tools become available to workflows.

## Typical flow

1. Register an MCP server in the Tools area.
2. Discover available tools from that server.
3. Configure tool parameters per node.

Use MCP when you want external tools to be managed and discovered at runtime.
