Tools allow agents to access external capabilities such as APIs, services, or custom integrations.

## Tool sources

- **MCP tools**: discovered from registered MCP servers.
- **System tools**: platform-managed built-ins.

## Tool usage

Tools are attached to tool-capable nodes. The configuration form is typically driven by a schema, so you can fill required fields without manual JSON edits.
