GEP Qi Studio uses server-sent events (SSE) to stream execution updates.

## What you see

- Live node start and completion highlights
- Incremental text output for LLM responses
- Tool call activity during execution

## Why it matters

Streaming provides immediate feedback during long runs and makes debugging faster by showing where execution is spending time.
