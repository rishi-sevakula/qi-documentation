Once a workflow is saved, you can execute it directly from the canvas.

## Steps

1. Open the workflow agent.
2. Click **Run** to open the execution panel.
3. Provide input and start the run.
4. Review the live execution status and final output.

Execution is tracked node-by-node so you can see where time is spent and where errors occur.
