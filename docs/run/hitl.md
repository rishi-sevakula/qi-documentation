description: Interrupt, review, and resume workflows.

Some workflows can pause execution to request human input or approval.

## How it works

1. A node triggers an interrupt and provides a form schema.
2. The UI prompts you for required inputs.
3. You choose to continue or stop the workflow.

HITL helps implement approval gates, safety checks, and exception handling in critical workflows.
