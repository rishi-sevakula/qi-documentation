title: Environments and Versions
description: Work safely across dev, test, and production environments.
---

Environments define where a workflow runs and which versions of apps/modules are active.

## Best practices

- Use non-production environments for development and testing.
- Refresh module configuration when switching context.
- Align tool configurations with the selected environment.

If you see inconsistent results, re-check the domain context and the selected module version.
